  post_title: "\"Dangerous\" Indeed: Simon & Schuster Imprint Publishing Book by White Supremacist"
---
<p id="yui_3_17_2_6_1483033483886_7078">Simon &amp; Schuster announced that it will be publishing <em>Dangerous</em>, a book by Milo Yiannopoulos, an editor at Breitbart and a white supremacist, in March 2017 under its Threshold imprint, which is devoted to conservatism. As a Simon &amp; Schuster author, I'm horrified that a company I've been proud to be associated with is giving a platform to Yiannopoulos.</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_6_1483033483886_7090">To be clear, the book isn't about white supremacy. The book is about free speech, and indeed Yiannopoulos is well-situated to write about free speech. White supremacy has a history of making people rethink their commitment to free speech (I'm thinking here of Skokie, Illinois, a heavily Jewish town where Nazis were allowed to march and display the swastika in 1977, thanks in part to the ACLU's efforts to support the Nazis' First Amendment rights). I don't want to stop Yiannopoulos from writing or publishing such a book—or any book, for that matter, even as I find his views despicable. Free speech, even when it's abhorrent, is a cornerstone of democracy.</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_6_1483033483886_7092">But the kind of "free speech" we're talking about here is the kind promised to us by our government, not the kind sold by for-profit companies like Simon &amp; Schuster. Nobody has a right to a book deal; not publishing this book, even if it never once uses the phrase "white supremacy," is not censorship or an abridgement of free speech. Yiannopoulos already has quite a mouthpiece at his disposal; this isn't an issue of him not being able to assert his views.</p>

<p><strong>The issue is that when a major publishing company gives a lucrative book deal to a white supremacist, it legitimizes him, even when the topic is free speech.</strong>

<p>Indeed, that's his entire goal in publishing the book, not getting his word out per se: "this book is the moment Milo goes mainstream," Yiannopoulos told The Hollywood Reporter. By publishing this book, Simon &amp; Schuster is enabling Yiannopoulos to "go mainstream," which normalizes his views and makes them seem like they should be a legitimate part of public discourse. It turns white supremacy into just another controversial viewpoint instead of a genuinely dangerous ideology that is gaining ground in our country by the minute. White supremacy kills people, and it will kill more people in the coming years.

<p>This isn't about me just not liking what Yiannopoulos has to say; I don't like <a href="http://www.thresholdeditions.com/">what most Threshold authors</a> have to say. (Threshold exists to "provide a forum for the creative people, bedrock principles, and innovative ideas of contemporary conservatism.") But there is a sharp difference between conservative thinking and white supremacy. No publisher has an intellectual obligation to give a mouthpiece to the latter.

<p id="yui_3_17_2_6_1483033483886_7104">I've been thinking a good deal about boycotts and their effectiveness, and I'm not sure that calling for a boycott of all Simon &amp; Schuster books is a great idea; I'm hesitant to say that you shouldn't buy good books that encourage clear thinking and open discourse—that seems counterproductive. But I will happily tell you that my book sales are far less important to me as a Simon &amp; Schuster author than us taking a stand against legitimizing white supremacists. (I will also point out that the <em><a href="https://autumn-whitefieldmadrano.squarespace.com/thebeheld#">Face Value </a></em><a href="https://autumn-whitefieldmadrano.squarespace.com/thebeheld#">audiobook</a> is not published by Simon &amp; Schuster, ahem.) If you want to contact the publisher, you can call Threshold at 212.698.7006 or email at gallerypublicity@simonandschuster.com. I'll continue to think on how I want to handle this as an author with the same publisher, and am open to suggestions.</p>
